# Refactoring and Testing Summary

## Codebase Simplification Summary

The codebase has been successfully refactored and simplified to reduce redundancy while maintaining functionality. The following key improvements were made:

### 1. Formatter Consolidation
- Consolidated multiple formatter implementations into a single `FormatFixer` class
- Extracted LaTeX utilities into a dedicated `latex_formatting.py` module
- Removed redundant files like `simplified_format_fixer.py` and `latex_aware_linking.py`

### 2. OCR Functionality Centralization
- Consolidated OCR functionality in the `ocr.py` module
- Created a thin wrapper in `notes.py` that calls the centralized OCR implementation
- Shared common post-processing code between OCR and other formatting functions

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- Fixed and enhanced existing tests to work with the new consolidated structure
- Created more targeted tests for core LaTeX formatting functions
- Added a complex test case to validate LaTeX handling in various scenarios
- Created a mock test for OCR functionality that doesn't rely on actual API calls

### 4. Improved Code Organization
- Better separation of concerns with clear module responsibilities
- More consistent function naming and organization
- Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability

## Test Results

All tests are now passing. The test suite covers:

1. Core LaTeX formatting functions (fix_math_content, fix_latex_delimiters, etc.)
2. FormatFixer functionality for basic and complex cases
3. OCR functionality with image reference extraction and processing
4. Post-processing for OCR and LLM output

## Next Steps

Potential areas for further improvement:

1. Add more comprehensive documentation throughout the codebase
2. Continue to refine the LaTeX handling for edge cases
3. Improve test coverage for specific functions
4. Optimize performance for larger documents
5. Implement additional error handling for edge cases

The codebase is now more maintainable, with a cleaner architecture and less redundancy, while maintaining full functionality.
