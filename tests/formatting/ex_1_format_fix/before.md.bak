**5. Subgame-Perfect Equilibria in Repeated [[Zero-Sum Games]]**

Let $G = \langle N, A, g \rangle $ be a finite, two-player, [[zero-sum game]] with $ N = {1,2}$, $ A = A_1 \times A_2$, and $ g_1(a) = u(a)$, ___INLINE_M $ for all $r ___DISPLAY_M$ is a maxmin action for player 2 if $__INLINE_MATH_11___delta) \sum_{t=0}^{\i $ by playing a stationary strategy $_2^t)] \g$ that always plays a [[maxmin]] action $ SPLAY_MATH_17___. Therefore,
_$. By symmetry and the zero-sum property, we also get $ quad \text{and} \quad u_1(\sigma_1, \sigma_2) \leq 
$$
 and 
$$
 ightarrow u_1 = v_1, \quad u_2 = v_2
$
$$

**(b) Subgame-perfect equilibrium implies [[maxmin]] payoffs in every subgame**

Let 
$$
(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)
$
$$
$$
 be a subgame-perfect equilibrium. Then for any history 
$
$$
 h 
$$
, the continuation strategy 
$
$$
(\sigma_1|h, \sigma_2|h)
$$
is a [[Nash equilibrium]] of the subgame. By (a), we must have:
$
$$
$$
$
$$
u_i(\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \mid h) = v_i \quad \text{for all } h
$$
