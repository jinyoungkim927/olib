Please transcribe the content from this image related to {note_name}.

Use the following formatting guidelines:
1. Convert all mathematical notation to proper LaTeX format with $ for inline math and $$ for display math
2. Format the response in clean markdown with appropriate headers, lists, and paragraphs
3. Use proper formatting for LaTeX with no escaped underscores (use a_1 not a\_1)
4. When appropriate, create WikiLinks [[Like This]] for key technical terms
5. Use consistent bullet points with hyphens (-)
6. Use proper spacing around LaTeX equations

IMPORTANT LaTeX Notes:
- Don't escape underscores inside math expressions: use $a_1$ not $a\_1$
- Use \text{} for text within math: $\text{This is text}$
- Ensure all math expressions are properly delimited: use $...$ (inline) or $$...$$ (display)
- Don't put spaces inside math delimiters: use $x$ not $ x $
- Make sure display math is properly formatted with $$ at the beginning and end
- Avoid line breaks inside equations unless necessary for readability
